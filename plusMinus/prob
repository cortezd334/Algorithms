Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10^-4 are acceptable.

Example

Input:
arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]

Output:
0.500000
0.333333
0.166667

Output Format

Print the following  lines, each to  decimals:

proportion of positive values
proportion of negative values
proportion of zeros
